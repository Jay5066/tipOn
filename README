====================================================================================================

tipOn is a titanium Alloy based application that utilizes the model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm,
which separates the application into three different components:

Models provide the business logic, containing the rules, data and state of the application.
Views provide the GUI components to the user, either presenting data or allowing the user to interact with the model data.
Controllers provide the glue between the model and view components in the form of application logic.
