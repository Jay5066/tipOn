<h1>tipOn</h1>			
===========================================================
<p>tipOn is a titanium Alloy based application that utilizes the model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm,
which separates the application into three different components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Models provide the business logic, containing the rules, data and state of the application.</li>
<li>Views provide the GUI components to the user, either presenting data or allowing the user to interact with the model data.</li>
<li>Controllers provide the glue between the model and view components in the form of application logic.</li>
</ul>
